# 🧪 SirenScripts Backend – API Layer for Portfolio Interactions

This is the backend component for my portfolio website [SirenScripts](https://rahules24.github.io/sirenscripts), built to handle dynamic, server-side features such as contact form submissions, API routing, and backend integration — all without coupling logic directly into the frontend.

## 🌐 Live API

🔗 [https://crypts.vercel.app](https://crypts.vercel.app)

> ⚡ Deployed on Vercel at `crypts.vercel.app`, powering dynamic features for my portfolio site.
> 
> ⚡ API endpoints are deployed serverlessly via Vercel for fast, globally distributed response times.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Acts as the backend complement to the [SirenScripts React Frontend](https://github.com/rahules24/sirenscripts)
- Designed to handle contact form submissions, email routing, and potential expansion (e.g., blogs, database, admin routes)
- Built with scalability and separation of concerns in mind

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Framework:** Express.js
- **Middleware:** CORS, Body Parser, etc.
- **Hosting:** Deployed on **Vercel** (serverless Node functions)
- **Frontend Integration:** Securely connects with the deployed React frontend for cross-origin requests

---

## 🔐 Design Highlights

- Clean, modular API structure under `/api`
- JSON-based form handling (e.g., contact form endpoints)
- Optimized for low-latency API calls from the portfolio frontend
- CORS-secured and lightweight – designed strictly for frontend support

---

This backend is minimal by design, but flexible enough to scale with future features like newsletter signups, file uploads, or portfolio analytics — while keeping the React frontend clean and fast.
